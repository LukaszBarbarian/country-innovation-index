# Country Innovation Index

**Country Innovation Index** ‚Äî an ETL / data lakehouse project that calculates and visualizes a country-level innovation score using publicly available data.

The project implements a layered Bronze ‚Üí Silver ‚Üí Gold (Medallion) architecture and is built to be modular, testable and cloud-deployable (Microsoft Azure).

## üöÄ Project summary

Project Overview & The Advanced Innovation Index
Goal: To design and calculate a proprietary Composite Innovation Index that ranks selected countries based on multiple publicly available socio-economic and scientific factors. The index is built using a robust methodology that includes normalization and dynamic weighting to handle data scarcity gracefully.

Advanced Index Calculation Methodology
Instead of a simple linear formula, the final Innovation Score is calculated as a dynamically weighted sum of four independent Sub-Indices. This approach provides a more nuanced and methodologically sound metric.

**Normalization**: All raw indicators are first transformed using the log(1+x) function to mitigate skewness from outliers (e.g., highly innovative microstates) and then scaled to a 0‚àí1 range using **MinMaxScaler**.

**Sub-Indices**: Scaled indicators are aggregated into four key sub-indices using fixed weights (e.g., Patents Index combines patents_per_million, resident_patents_per_million, and patent_expansion_ratio).

**Dynamic Weighting**: If a country is missing data for an entire Sub-Index (e.g., research_index), that sub-index is excluded from the final calculation, and the weights of the remaining sub-indices are dynamically rescaled to sum up to 1.0, ensuring the final score remains fair and comparable.

| Sub-Index | Weight | Description | Key Indicators (Normalized) |
| :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **Patents Index** | 35% | Measures intellectual property output. | Total Patents, Resident Patents, Patent Expansion Ratio |
| **Research Index** | 35% | Focuses on human capital in science. | Researchers per Million, Nobel Laureates per Million |
| **R&D Index** | 20% | Measures investment in future growth. | R&D Expenditure % GDP |
| **Unemployment Index** | 10% | Captures labor market efficiency (Inverted). | Graduate Unemployment Rate |

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture (high-level)

A concise, non-redundant description of the Medallion implementation used in this project. The goal here is clarity: each layer has a short purpose, the core components used and the artifact it produces.

**Bronze** ‚Äî Raw ingestion
- **Purpose**: Capture raw payloads exactly as delivered by sources (API responses, uploaded files).
- **Core pieces**: Azure Durable Function (`IngestNow`) driven by manifests; ADLS Gen2 Bronze path; ADF trigger to start ingestion.
- **Artifact**: Raw files in `/bronze/{source}/{dataset}-{date}.json` and a small summary file `/bronze/outputs/ingestion_summaries/ingestion_summary__{correlation_id}.json`.
- **Signal**: Event Grid message containing the summary file URL.
  
**Silver** ‚Äî Enriching & modeling
- **Purpose**: Clean, normalize, enrich and model data into Delta Tables for downstream consumption.
- **Core pieces**: PySpark notebooks (local for dev or Databricks for prod), reference tables, manual data (e.g. patents CSV).
- **Artifact**: Delta tables (e.g. `COUNTRY`, `NOBEL_LAUREATES`, `POPULATION`) and a processing summary `/silver/outputs/summaries/processing_summary__{correlation_id}.json`.
- **Signal**: Event Grid message with path to the processing summary.

**Gold** ‚Äî Analytics & reporting
- **Purpose**: Produce business-ready datasets, apply final calculations, and expose them to BI tools.
- **Core pieces**: `FactInnovationBuilder` (implements normalization, sub-indices and weighting), Delta output, optional Synapse SQL view for Power BI.
- **Artifact**: `fact_innovation` (Delta table) and `gold/outputs/summaries/processing_summary__{correlation_id}.json` (validation + location).

| Area | Technologies | Functionality |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Orchestration** | Azure Data Factory, Azure Event Grid | Pipeline automation, event-driven layer communication. |
| **Processing** | Apache Spark (PySpark, local), Azure Durable Functions | MinMaxScaler, Log Transformation, complex index calculation. |
| **Data Warehouse** | Azure Synapse Analytics (Dedicated SQL Pool) | Final reporting layer for Power BI. |
| **Data Lakehouse** | Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (Delta Lake) | Layered storage (Bronze/Silver/Gold). |
| **Reporting** | Power BI | Visualization and business analysis. |
| **Automation** | Terraform, GitHub Actions | IaC (Infrastructure as Code) and CI/CD. |

## üîÅ Data flow & Summaries (clean, step-by-step)

This section describes the exact sequence from trigger ‚Üí ingestion ‚Üí final output, with emphasis on the summary JSON artifacts and traceability.

1. **Start** ‚Äî ADF trigger (scheduled or manual) invokes the Bronze pipeline and generates a `correlation_id` GUID for the run.

2. **Manifest delivery** ‚Äî Bronze pipeline reads a manifest from `bronze/manifest/dev.manifest.json` in Storage and forwards it (with `correlation_id`) to the Durable Function IngestNow.

3. **Ingestion** ‚Äî `IngestNow` executes tasks listed in the manifest (APIs / file ingests), stores raw payloads in Bronze and produces an ingestion summary file located at:

`bronze/outputs/ingestion_summaries/ingestion_summary__{correlation_id}.json` The summary contains: `correlation_id`, `etl_layer`, `status`, `proccessed_items`, `results` with each item summary.

4. **Bronze ‚Üí Event Grid** ‚Äî The function publishes an Event Grid event that includes the storage URL to the ingestion summary.

5. **Silver consumption** ‚Äî The Silver pipeline (listening to Event Grid) downloads the ingestion summary, resolves the Bronze files it needs and runs the PySpark notebook which builds Delta tables. When finished it writes:

`silver/outputs/summaries/processing_summary__{correlation_id}.json` The summary contains: `correlation_id`, `etl_layer`, `status`, `proccessed_models` and `results` with each model summary.

6. **Silver ‚Üí Event Grid** ‚Äî Silver publishes the processing summary to Event Grid so Gold can start.

7. **Gold processing & publish** ‚Äî Gold runs `FactInnovationBuilder`, computes `fact_innovation`, writes the Delta output and emits:

`gold/outputs/summaries/gold_summary__{correlation_id}.json` The gold summary contains final table location(s), validation metrics (row counts, key distribution checks) and an overall run status.

8. **Traceability & idempotency** ‚Äî Every artifact (manifests, summary files, created tables) embeds the `correlation_id`. Durable Functions and orchestrators use idempotency keys to ensure retries do not produce duplicates.

All pipeline executions are correlated by a `correlation_id` GUID for traceability.

## üßæ Example summary messages

After Bronze completes, the Durable Function emits `ingestion_summary__` (example):

```json
{
    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "env": "dev",
    "etl_layer": "bronze",
    "correlation_id": "07fa9c40-5d30-421f-8614-24a63b4d19f9",
    "timestamp": "2025-09-20T00:01:37.543092",
    "processed_items": 6,
    "duration_in_ms": 33400,
    "results": [
        {
            "status": "COMPLETED",
            "correlation_id": "07fa9c40-5d30-421f-8614-24a63b4d19f9",
            "duration_in_ms": 2441,
            "record_count": 1004,
            "domain_source": "NOBELPRIZE",
            "domain_source_type": "api",
            "dataset_name": "laureates",
            "message": "API data successfully processed. Uploaded 1 file with 1004 records.",
            "output_paths": [
                "https://demosurdevdatalake4418sa.blob.core.windows.net/bronze/nobelprize/2025/09/20/laureates_07fa9c40-5d30-421f-8614-24a63b4d19f9_d2b028b2.json"
            ],
            "start_time": "2025-09-20T00:01:20.303335",
            "end_time": null,
            "error_details": {}
        },
        {
```

Silver's `processing_summary__.json` may look like:

```json
{
    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "env": "dev",
    "etl_layer": "silver",
    "correlation_id": "37037a0e-72d8-49d8-93bb-ca9a84b69f5b",
    "timestamp": "2025-09-17T09:29:18.173977",
    "processed_models": 9,
    "duration_in_ms": 651754,
    "results": [
        {
            "model": "COUNTRY",
            "status": "COMPLETED",
            "output_path": "abfss://silver@demosurdevdatalake4418sa.dfs.core.windows.net/COUNTRY",
            "correlation_id": "37037a0e-72d8-49d8-93bb-ca9a84b69f5b",
            "operation_type": "UPSERT",

            "error_details": {},
            "duration_in_ms": 39817
        },
```


Gold publishes `gold_summary.json` with the location of `fact_innovation`.

```json
{
    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "env": "dev",
    "etl_layer": "gold",
    "correlation_id": "37037a0e-72d8-49d8-93bb-ca9a84b69f5b",

            "status": "COMPLETED",
            "output_path": "abfss://gold@demosurdevdatalake4418sa.dfs.core.windows.net/dim_country",
            "correlation_id": "37037a0e-72d8-49d8-93bb-ca9a84b69f5b",
            "operation_type": "UPSERT",
            "record_count": 249,
            "error_details": {},

## üß† Code patterns & implementation notes

**Software Design Patterns (Python)**
The codebase uses patterns to enhance flexibility, readability, and testability:

**Factory Pattern:**
Used to dynamically create class instances based on the ETL layer (Bronze/Silver/Gold).

The base class BaseFactoryFromRegistry and the specific OrchestratorFactory automatically return the correct BaseOrchestrator object for a given layer.

**Orchestrator Pattern:**
Every major operation in a layer (e.g., BronzeOrchestrator) inherits from BaseOrchestrator, centralizing execution logic and managing the correlation_id for consistent end-to-end tracking.

**Configuration and Tracking**
Centralization: Configuration is managed via Azure App Configuration, enabling a single source of truth for both Azure Functions (Python) and Spark transformations (PySpark).

**Security**: Sensitive data (API keys) is stored securely in Azure Key Vault and referenced through App Configuration.

**Traceability**: All operations are linked by a unique correlation_id, passed between layers (Bronze ‚Üí Silver ‚Üí Gold) via Event Grid, allowing for full auditing of the entire data flow.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Quick run (short)

> Note: a full run requires an Azure subscription with permissions to create ADLS, ADF, Functions and Key Vault.

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LukaszBarbarian/country-innovation-index.git
cd country-innovation-index
```

2. Edit Terraform variables in `infra/terraform/` (subscription, resource group, location), then:

```bash
terraform init
terraform apply
```

3. Configure GitHub Actions secrets (Azure credentials, storage connection, Key Vault secrets).

4. Let the CI/CD pipeline deploy Functions + ADF (the workflow will push manifests and code).

5. Trigger Bronze via ADF trigger or call `IngestNow` locally for debugging.

6. Run Silver/Gold notebooks locally on Spark or configure Databricks.
